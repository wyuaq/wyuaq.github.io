== About me
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UBC, hosted by [https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~vincentw/Homepage/Home.html Prof. Vincent Wong]. I received my Ph.D. in Electronic and Computer Engineering at HKUST in 2025, supervised by [https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eekhaled Prof. Khaled B. Letaief]. From Sept. 2024 to Jul. 2025, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at MIT, where I worked with [https://lizhongzheng.github.io Prof. Lizhong Zheng]. Prior to these, I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Science and Engineering from Nanjing University in 2021, advised by [https://ese.nju.edu.cn/wangsw/ Prof. Shaowei Wang].  \n

My research explores the intersection of *signal processing* and *machine learning* to develop advanced algorithms for *next-generation wireless communications and sensing*. I am interested in application domains such as millimeter-wave and terahertz systems, near-field communications and sensing, and ultra-massive MIMO systems. I received the National Scholarship in 2018 and the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS) in 2021. 

# == Research Interests 
# - Statistical Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Point Process, Optimization, Fairness
# - Data Mining, Information Retrieval, Recommender System 
# - Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Natural Language Processing
