== About me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in electronic and computer engineering at HKUST, under the supervision of [https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=6WLhtHgAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Khaled B. Letaief]. Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. degree in electronic science and engineering from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2021, advised by [https://ese.nju.edu.cn/wangsw/ Prof. Shaowei Wang]. Since Sept. 2024, I have been a visiting Ph.D. student at MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, working with [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WeW5WsgAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Lizhong Zheng]. \n

My research explores the intersection of *signal processing* and *machine learning* to develop advanced transceiver algorithms for *next-generation wireless systems*. I am particularly interested in application domains such as millimeter-wave and terahertz systems, near-field communications and sensing, and ultra-massive/holographic MIMO systems. I received the National Scholarship in 2018 and the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS) in 2021. 
#Some of my past research projects are summarized in this [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09839 tutorial paper].

# == Research Interests 
# - Statistical Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Point Process, Optimization, Fairness
# - Data Mining, Information Retrieval, Recommender System 
# - Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Natural Language Processing

== Contact
Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research or would like to have a chat. Looking forward to hearing from you!
